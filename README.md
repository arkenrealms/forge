# Arken Forge

Meta-repo for Forge surfaces.

## Structure
- `packages/web` → `arkenrealms/forge-web` (submodule)

## Notes
- This repository mostly tracks submodule pointers and rollup docs.
- `.gitmodules` pins `packages/web` to track `main`; pointer updates should be reviewed as runtime-impacting changes.
